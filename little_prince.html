 As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in

my arms and set out walking once more. 
</body>
<style>

<p1>
I felt deeply


 moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was

carrying a very fragile treasure. </p1>
<span style = "background:orange">
It seemed to me, even,

that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. </span>
In the 
moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed 
eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I 

said to myself: 

<style>
p2{ color:red;
}
</style>
<p2>
"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..."
</p2>

As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again:

<style>
p3{ color:red;
}
</style>
<p3>

"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..."
</p3>
And I felt him to be more fragile still.


<p1>
I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...
